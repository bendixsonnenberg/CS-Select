   (Where `$CATALINA_HOME` is the Tomcat homedirectory)

1. Start the ML-Server on the hostname specified in the config
1. go to [http://localhost:8080/CS-Select/](http://localhost:8080/CS-Select/) to use CS-Select
1. to register a new organiser they need the masterpassword which is set in the config.properties

## Developer setup
If you want to expand CS:Select with your own additions, use the following setup explanation
- Install tomcat-9 from the official [Tomcat Website](http://tomcat.apache.org/) 
- In your Tomcat installation folder edit `conf/tomcat-users.xml`.
    Add the following at the end of the file 
    ```xml
    <tomcat-users>
        <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
        <role rolename="manager-script"/>
        <user username="admin" password="password" roles="manager-gui,manager-script" />
    </tomcat-users>
    ```
- Start Tomcat with either `bin/startup.sh` or `bin/startup.bat` (in Tomcat folder) depending on your OS.
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Put the default configuration file into the `conf/Catalina/cs_select directory` inside your tomcat home directory and edit it as you see fit. If the directory doesn't exist, create the folders.
- Deploy the project from the command line by typing `mvn tomcat7:deploy` whilst in the repository folder
- Access the server from a browser under the address [http://localhost:8080/CS-Select/](http://localhost:8080/CS-Select/) (If you used the default settings in
 Tomcat)
 
 ## How to develop
 CS:Select is realised as a simple maven project, so it can be used in any supported IDE. However we recommend
 developing in IntelliJ Idea, as we integrated the JetBrains language plugin which allows for easy language injection
 via Annotations to allow for syntax highlighting and auto-completion of different languages inside your java code
 (e.g. SQL)
 ## Configuration Values
 - organiserpassword: The password an organiser has to supply to be able to register a new account
 - mlserverurl: The URL the ML-Server is available under
 - homedirectory: The directory path in which CS:Select will save downloaded featuresets from the ML-Server
 - timezone: The timezone your server uses
 - database.hostname: The hostname of your database server
 - database.port: The port of your database server
 - database.username: The username of your database-user
 - database.password: The password of your database-user
 - email.hostname: The hostname of the email-server CS:Select uses for sending invitation mails
 - email.port: The port of the email-server
 - email.address: The email address to use for sending invitations
 - email.password: The password to the email account
 
 ## Logger Configuration
 The Logger used by CS:Select is the [tinylog-framework](https://tinylog.org/). Tinylog can be configured in a multitude
 of ways through a properties file. If you don't want to use our default way of logging (to console and log.txt in the
 CS:Select home directory) you can create a logger.properties file in the `conf/Catalina/cs_select` directory and fill
 it with values as described in detail in the [tinylog documentation](https://tinylog.org/configuration#settings)
