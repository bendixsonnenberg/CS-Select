# CS-Select

## Installation
### Manual
1. Install tomcat-9 from official [Tomcat Website](http://tomcat.apache.org/)
1. Install MySql-Server version 5.7.20 from the official [MySql Website](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/installer/)
1. (Optional but recommended) Install MySql-Workbench from the official [MySql Website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
1. Install [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for your system
1. Edit values in example-conf.properties and move the new file to `$CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/cs_select/config.properties`
   (Where `$CATALINA_HOME` is the Tomcat homedirectory)
1. (Optional) If you don't want to use the default logging settings, refer to the [Logger configuration section](#Logger Configuration)
1. The MySql-user has to be allowed to create new databases. If you don't want to use a default MySql-user he has to be
   created (e.g. with MySql-Workbench) and the config edited accordingly
1. Execute mvn package
1. Copy `target/CS-Select.war` to `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/`
1. Start tomcat by executing `$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh` on Linux or `$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.bat` on Windows
1. Start the ML-Server on the hostname specified in the config
1. go to [http://localhost:8080/CS-Select/](http://localhost:8080/CS-Select/) to use CS-Select
1. to register a new organiser they need the masterpassword which is set in the config.properties
### Docker
1. Refer to [https://github.com/bendixsonnenberg/CS-Select-Docker](https://github.com/bendixsonnenberg/CS-Select-Docker)

## Developer setup
If you want to expand CS:Select with your own additions, use the following setup explanation (Or just use the docker-repository)
- Follow steps 1-7 from the manual setup
- In your Tomcat installation folder edit `conf/tomcat-users.xml`.
    Add the following before the `</tomcat-users>` line at the end of the file
    ``` xml
        <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
        <role rolename="manager-script"/>
        <user username="admin" password="password" roles="manager-gui,manager-script" />
    ```
- Start Tomcat with either `bin/startup.sh` or `bin/startup.bat` (in Tomcat folder) depending on your OS.
- Start the ML-Server on the hostname and port specified in the config
- Deploy the project from the command line by typing `mvn tomcat7:redeploy` whilst in the repository folder
- Access the server from a browser under the address [http://localhost:8080/CS-Select/](http://localhost:8080/CS-Select/) (If you used the default settings in
 Tomcat)
 
 ## How to develop
 CS:Select is realised as a simple maven project, so it can be used in any supported IDE. However we recommend
 developing in IntelliJ Idea, as we integrated the JetBrains language plugin which allows for easy language injection
 via Annotations to allow for syntax highlighting and auto-completion of different languages inside your java code
 (e.g. SQL)
 ## Configuration Values
 - organiserpassword: The password an organiser has to supply to be able to register a new account
 - mlserverurl: The URL the ML-Server is available under
 - homedirectory: The directory path in which CS:Select will save downloaded featuresets from the ML-Server
 - csselecturl: The URL CS:Select will be accessible under. Used e.g. in invitation mails
 - timezone: The timezone your server uses
 - database.hostname: The hostname of your database server
 - database.port: The port of your database server
 - database.username: The username of your database-user
 - database.password: The password of your database-user
 - email.hostname: The hostname of the email-server CS:Select uses for sending invitation mails
 - email.port: The port of the email-server
 - email.address: The email address to use for sending invitations
 - email.password: The password to the email account
 
 ## Logger Configuration
 The Logger used by CS:Select is the [tinylog-framework](https://tinylog.org/). Tinylog can be configured in a multitude
 of ways through a properties file. If you don't want to use our default way of logging (to console and log.txt in the
 CS:Select home directory) you can create a `logger.properties` file in the `conf/Catalina/cs_select` directory and fill
 it with values as described in detail in the [tinylog documentation](https://tinylog.org/configuration#settings)
 
 # Localisation
 The local Strings are stored in [src/main/resources/locale/Locale.properties](src/main/resources/locale/Locale.properties) and the 
 respective language files. 
 ### Add new languages 
 1. Add new Locale file to the resource path mentioned above. Name it accordingly (`Locale_xx.properties`). If the ML server does not supply the feature description in this language(same country code), the english version will be used.
 2. Add new option to [setting.js](src/main/webapp/src/js/settings.js). (data.languageoptions array has to be extended)
 3. (Optional) Add new constant to `com/csselect/utils/Languages.java` instead of directly using the language code to allow for easy refactoring of language codes in the java code
 
 - For non ascii characters you will have to use the `native2ascii` tool by Oracle, or an alternative that converts UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1 standart ([native2ascii](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/native2ascii.html)).
 It converts characters like `Ã¼` to the `\uxxxx` notation.
 
 # Known issues
 - Only works with MySql Version 5.7.20
 - pattern loading doesn't load termination value
 ## Potential out-of-memory-error
 When creating multiple games in a row there might happen an Out-of-memory-error and the dataset will not be written to
 the database correctly when using Tomcat. This can occur if the application is redeployed often, as Tomcat has a problem
 with memory leaking when redeploying often. Restarting Tomcat fixes this. Though this should not happen in productive use, 
 as you won't be redeploying your application as often as when developing, you might as well try using CS:Select with a
 different web-container application because as far as is known to us our application doesn't use any tomcat specific code.
